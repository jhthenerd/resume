% As a student looking to enter the field of software engineering in post-secondary and beyond, I am interested in applying for the Innovation Developer position at RBC High School Labs.

% I have been programming since middle school, and have undergone both informal and formal training in software development.
% I have worked on various software projects, both independently and as part of a team, and have been attending hackathons for over 2 years.
% I have also worked on larger projects within my community, such as developing a tool to digitize announcements and increase student body interaction within our school.
% Our project leader introduced me to agile development, which allowed us to be efficient and work quickly to produce deliverables for our 
% Through these experiences, I have learned to innovate and prototype concepts in a short timeframe.

% As for programming education, I am currently in Grade 11 at John Fraser Secondary School and have had formal education in Python and Java. 
% Outside of school, I have also had formal education on C++ back in middle school, and have been self-taught in Javascript and Go.
% I learned React and React Native through various hackathon and group development projects.

% I understand that this will be a popular position, but I believe that my experience in development and team collaboration will lead to a productive environment at RBC.

% I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you in an interview to discuss this position.
% I can be reached via email or phone on the details above.
